This example illustrates how to write a proof and how to use guiding text to help readers follow your argument. A LaTex version of this file is also provided for use as a model.

This annotated journal article\* illustrates structuring a longer paper and various other math writing conventions and strategies.

[Acknowledging sources (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_310f13_acknowledg)  
This one-page handout describes when and how to acknowledge/cite sources. It was written for term papers, but much of the advice applies to shorter writing as well.

[Common comments on 18.310 writing (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit18_310f13_code_comm)  
This is a list of common comments compiled from when the course was taught during Spring 2012. It is organized into categories such as how to structure a paper, acknowledge contributors, incorporate equations, and make revisions. These guidelines may be helpful for writing well, but they are not sufficient. Remain focused on your goal: to write clearly and convincingly for the assigned context.
